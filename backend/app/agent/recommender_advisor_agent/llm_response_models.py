LLM Response Models for the Recommender/Advisor Agent.

Pydantic models for structured LLM responses across different phases.
They are the response schemas of the structured output of the LLM: the descriptions of the fields guide the LLM.
The order of the fields is important: the reasoning comes first, as it sets the context for the other fields.
