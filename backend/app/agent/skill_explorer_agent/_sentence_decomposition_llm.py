        # Do not interpret
            Do not infer the my responsibilities, skills, duties, tasks, actions, behaviour, activities, competencies, or knowledge based on your prior knowledge about the experience.
            Do not infer the experience and do not use that information in your task.
            Use only information that is present in <My Last Input> and <Conversation History>.
        # Scope
            Decompose ONLY the sentences of <My Last Input>.
            Use <Conversation History> solely to resolve what the pronouns and references in <My Last Input> refer to.
            Never output a sentence for something that is only said in <Conversation History> and is not stated in <My Last Input>.
        # Keep my wording
            Reuse my exact words, word order and tense. Do not use synonyms, do not reorder words, do not change the tense,
            and do not add or remove words. Keep adverbs and modifiers such as "sometimes", "very early in the morning" or "myself".
            The only changes you are allowed to make are:
                - split a sentence into standalone sub-sentences and drop the connectors that only linked them (e.g. "and", "but", "then", "also"),
                - repeat the subject when it was omitted (e.g. "I heat the ovens, clean the place" -> "I heat the ovens", "I clean the place"),
                - replace pronouns and references with what they refer to, adapting the verb agreement when needed
                  (e.g. "We do it" where "it" is shaping the dough -> "John and I shape the dough").
            For example: "I cook. I also wash the dishes and then sometimes I dry them myself" ->
                "I cook.", "I wash the dishes.", "Sometimes I dry the dishes myself."
            Start every sentence with a capital letter and end it with a period.
        # 'decomposed_sentences' instructions
            Extract and accurately identify and separate the main actions from their purpose or descriptive clauses and decompose complex sentences from the <My Last Input> into sub-sentences.
            
            Main Action Sub-Sentences: Convert each main action into a standalone sentence. Each sub-sentence contains exactly one main action:
            split the actions joined by "and", "but" or commas, and split the actions in relative clauses
            (e.g. "My aunt eats the cake that I baked" -> "My aunt eats the cake", "I baked the cake"),
            but not a relative clause about what someone needs, has or wants (e.g. "I buy the tools we need" stays one sentence).
            Keep a purpose or reason clause (e.g. "to ...", "so that ...", "because ...") and a time clause (e.g. "after ...", "when ...")
            in the same sub-sentence as the main action it directly belongs to, and only with that action
            (e.g. "My son eats the soup that I cooked after I came home" -> "My son eats the soup.", "I cooked the soup after I came home.").
            
            The sum of the sub-sentences should cover all the information in the original sentence and preserve the original meaning.
            Each piece of information must appear in exactly one sub-sentence: do not output both a sentence and its parts,
            and do not duplicate sub-sentences that are similar and do not convey new information. Be as concise as possible.
            The sub-sentence must incorporate parts of the <Conversation History>, so that the sub-sentence is standalone and can be understood
            without the need to refer back to the <Conversation History>.
            Include all information about the action, including the subject, verb, and object.
            Place each sub-sentence as a separate item in the 'decomposed_sentences' list.
        # 'pronouns_indexing' instructions
            Identify all unique pronouns in <My Last Input> and <Conversation History>.
            Include all possessive, reflexive, demonstrative, relative, interrogative, indefinite, reciprocal, and intensive pronouns.
            Exclude first person pronouns (I, me, my, mine etc.) and second person pronouns (you, your, yours etc.) that refer to me.
            First person plural pronouns (we, us, our, ours etc.) are not excluded when they refer to me together with other people.
            
            List each unique pronoun only once, even if it appears multiple times in the text.
            For each pronoun provide the pronoun type in the format: "pronoun -> pronoun type".
            Keep this list concise - only include pronouns that need to be resolved.
            If a word might be a pronoun but it is not clear, indicate that it is ambiguous.
        # 'pronouns_antecedents'  instructions  
            Identify all unique pronouns in <My Last Input> and <Conversation History> and determine their antecedents.
            Exclude first person pronouns (I, me, my, mine etc.) and second person pronouns (you, your, yours etc.) that refer to me.
            First person plural pronouns (we, us, our, ours etc.) are not excluded when they refer to me together with other people.
            List each unique pronoun only once, even if it appears multiple times in the text.
            For each pronoun, provide the antecedent in the format: "pronoun -> antecedent" and briefly explain the reasoning behind the choice of antecedent.
            Keep this list concise - only include pronouns that need to be resolved.
            If a pronoun does not have a clear antecedent, indicate that it is ambiguous.
            
        # 'resolved_pronouns' instructions
            Replace all pronouns (expect the ones that refer to the first person), in the 'decomposed_sentences' with the specific nouns or phrases they reference.
            Replace first person plural pronouns (we, us, our etc.) with the people they refer to, naming me as "I" (e.g. "we" -> "John and I") when they are known.
            The antecedent should not show up multiple times in the same sentence.
            Use <My Last Input> and <Conversation History> to determine the antecedent.            
            All information from the original sentence is preserved and covered.
            Place each rephrased sentence as a separate item in the 'resolved_pronouns' list.
        
        # Helper fields
            IMPORTANT: Do not repeat entries in pronouns_indexing or pronouns_antecedents. Each unique pronoun should appear only once in each list.
            These are helper fields to guide your reasoning - they should be brief and not repetitive.
